                        <p class="p4 p3">Software engineering changed my life.</p>
                        <p class="p2 p4">I first learnt to code in University in America when I was 19, and with those skills I was able to get multiple job offers after graduation. . Seeing how young people in America were able to use tech to change their lives, I badly wanted to bring this back to Nigeria so I moved back when I was just 22 to start my first company. I hired and trained a team of Nigerian uni grads and we were able to achieve many groundbreaking milestones like Nigeria’s first mobile internet service in partnership with MTN Nigeria and Nigeria’s first mobile banking service.</p>

                            <p class="p3 p4">That experience confirmed what I already believed that with great tech training and the right opportunity, exceptional young Nigerians can transform their lives and the lives of others through tech. I went on to back many other brilliant young Nigerians software teams to start companies like Jobberman, Cheki, Bamboo and Gokada and then in 2018 I decided to move from investing in companies to investing directly in people by launching Decagon. Decagon helps exceptional young Nigerians to become software engineers by finding, financing, training and offering placement support to help people like you launch and grow careers in tech.</p>
                            <p class="p3 p4">Many brilliant Nigerians are unemployed or underemployed because of a lack of opportunity but we see Decagon as a bridge between exceptional talent and opportunity. We hate to see either talent or opportunity wasting and we are here to end that in Nigeria.</p>
                            <p class="p3 p4">We have over 500 graduates or Decadevs trained and now working with reputable companies globally - from banks like Sterling, Access Bank, and JPMorgan, to Fintechs like Opay, Flutterwave, and Carbon and even US-based unicorns like Indeed. As far as the Nigerian tech industry is concerned, if you "look under the hood of 10 tech companies, you will probably find Decadevs in 8.</p>
                            <p class="p3 p4">If you consider yourself to be a person of exceptional potential and you are determined to make the most of your god-given talent then we look forward to building a future in the tech space with you.</p>
